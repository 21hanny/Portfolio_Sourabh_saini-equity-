## 💡 Investment Strategy & Approach

I focus on identifying companies that demonstrate:

* **Strong fundamentals and balance sheet quality**
* **High margins and sustainable profitability**
* **Market leadership or monopoly-like positioning**
    > (e.g., Dixon Technologies, Force Motors)
* **Exposure to sectors with long-term structural tailwinds**
* **Consistent high CAGR potential**

My approach is rooted in **deep fundamental research**, **data-driven thesis building**, and **early identification of sector inflection points**—supported by disciplined risk management and continuous monitoring.
