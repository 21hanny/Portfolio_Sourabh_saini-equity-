Investment Strategy & Approach

I focus on identifying companies that demonstrate:

Strong fundamentals and balance sheet quality

High margins and sustainable profitability

Market leadership or monopoly-like positioning
(e.g., Dixon Technologies, Force Motors)

Exposure to sectors with long-term structural tailwinds

Consistent high CAGR potential

My approach is rooted in deep fundamental research, data-driven thesis building, and early identification of sector inflection points—supported by disciplined risk management and continuous monitoring.
