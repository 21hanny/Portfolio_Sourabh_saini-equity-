Over the past 3 years, I’ve built an investment portfolio delivering a 145% XIRR—outperforming the NIFTY 500 by 4.45x. This was driven by early positioning and over 2+ of rigerous deep research across various industries and sectors. 
- I have diversified my portfolio in multiple sectors including Pharmaceutical , Defence , Fintech, Eneregy stocks - Tarditinal + clean , retails , Automotve, renewable energy, and PSU bank, and minor stakes in Insurances providers (private + public) turnaround opportunities. 
- I have also included some niece stocks from industries  (cloud computing SAAS companies and semiconductor manufacturers) in my portfolio.
